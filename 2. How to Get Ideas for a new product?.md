1. Build audience - twitter, instagram, ... doesn't matter once you have audience any idea remotely suitable for them will win
2. Partner with an exper - if you're a developer then the scope of problems you know is very limited and occupied by people with skills far greater than yours
3. Solve your own problem - YC and many say to do this and it makes sense, at least idea is based on something practical
4. Me Too - Bring working idea to a different market. i.e. Amazon in India? Reddit only for Singapore?
5. Digitalize - Make something that is  done manually to online, tech inherently has many advantageous so it's likely whatever the process manually if can be digitalize it'd get faster and better. Let alone automation.
6. Reviews - Reviews can give insights into problems you are not aware of, whether it's Amazon product reviews or G2.com Software reviews
7. Attend Trade Shows - Wanna see what's trending in the industry and be around people with 10+ years experience in the industry attend tradeshows and conferences
8. Read Industry News and Magazines - Every industry has a way to pass around information, wheter it's newsletter, email chain, magazines, or news website. This is one way to get even closer to the industry
9. Offer consulting - Often consutlants get wholistic view of the business and recognize many problems in the industry but won't have time/resources/skills to build a product to solve them you can partner with them, or become a consultant
10. Get rid of middlemen - Can you cut down cost by getting rid of middlemen? Real estate for low fixed price instead of paying comission?
11. Copy but Improve - Better product = Better demand, usually you have to make it better for a certain group of people, niche/segment.
12. Ideate based on new trendsd - New trends could come about due to Events (covid, war,...), Changes in landscape (Notion, airtable, shopify), New Regulation, New Tech (steam  engine, electricity,  internet, smartphone),  New Biz Models (free forever storage = new startup models)... anytime there is a change whether is short or long term, there are new oppurtunities
13. Simplify - If you can make something simple, it's a win. Especially true in B2C space.
14. Remix - There is a cycle of bundling and debundling that goes back and worth. i.e. Craigslist to (ebay and airbnb) - Debundling. Ebay + MySpace to Facebook/Marketplace - Bundling.
15. Join existing company - Being 2nd, 3rd, or even 11th Employee is safer and can be more profitable then starting something on your own and likely failing
16. Existing Platform - many millionares who built something for existing platforms (addons for wordpress, shopify, etc) the newer the platform the better your chances of dominating the space
17. Change one of 3 - Market | Problem | Solution
18. Adjacent Idea - Like building addons for existing platforms you can also offer standalone service/product that provide support to growing platform. I.e Course on how to do FB marketing, Shipping managemenet for Shopify Owners, Marketing guide for new entreprenuers at Shopify
19. Same old - You can have legitmate business that's traditional and a great way to build generational wealth. These time-tested business stay around and have been there. Sure they don't return 100x, but they also are less riskier. Franchise, laundry, etc.
