### Distribution
If a product has better distribution, meaning product supply chain makes restocking quicker and makes it available at multitude of stores as widely as possible geographically speaking, then this product would naturally sell more than product that is same but doesn't have equivalent supply chain.

### Pricing
People buy cheaper one over expensive one.

 - Two USB drives both 120gb in space, I will buy $14 one over $22 one, so will most other people. 8/10.
 - Depends on information asymmetry. If product  spec is standardized and well defined the more price sensitive it's, i.e. Designer Bag vs Computer RAM. It's easier to compare two RAMs objectively for the most part, whereas designer bags are very subjective. Is leather/material really expensive, Is it more beautiful?

### Availability
I'll buy stuff that is available over that is not. There are very few scenarios where I'll come back to buy something when it's available, marginal utility of such items are really close. 

- I came in to  buy Spring Water bottle, but it was out of stock, so I just bought random brand name water gallon.

### Scarcity
I am more likely to buy something if I think it won't be available in future or if its prices are going to increase. Toiler paper? :D

### Principles/Religious
I sometimes buy stuff not because I needed it, but because it's for my principles, i.e. I should support local businesses, or religious ceremony accessories.

### Curiosity
I sometimes buy something because I want to know how it works, how much better it's... there is a feeling of having found something novel, and you have to know what is it.

- I bought a pen for $20 because someone said this pen uses some unique technology and makes writing really easy. Do I write with a pen these days? No, I don't. I just wanted to see how true was the review and how does it feel.

### Risk/Safety
I buy something to de-risk something or for safety reason: insurance, antivirus, metal door... Stuff that doesn't help me right away but makes me feel safer.

### Support
Given two identical items, I'm more likely to buy an item where I know I'll be supported after the purchase, meaning help with debugging, customization, returns, shipping, refunds, customer support, and so on. The more complex and unfamiliar something the more support I'd prefer. Also, enterprise customers require training and support.

### Convenience
Sure milk at a store far away is $3.50 but I'll just pay $5 to store near me. It's more convenient right now. The calculus of opportunity cost says that money saved is not worth going to far away store right now for 1 Gallon of milk.  Amazon is more convenient to refund. Apps are easier uninstall if they suck.

### Speed 
How quickly will I get the item, main reason I use Amazon Prime. It includes speed of buying, to acquiring the item to be at home with it. I pick store with smaller lines even if they are further away from my home, I'd rather walk 5 more mins, at least I'm getting some cardio in. Less opportunity cost. 

### Self-Reward
I sometimes buy something with lower value/price ratio intentionally as a reward.

### Fun
I pay to have fun, not because I needed it.

### Legal
Pretty self explanatory, legally required to have it or better to have it then risk legal problems.

### Ease
Different from convenience. It's convenient to order from Amazon $$$, but I use Gmail but of its EASE.

### Compatibility
Sometimes I have to buy something despite it being an inferior product because it's what is compatible with what I have.

### Fame/Public Status
Why did Jake (alias for my friend) buy an Iphone for $1000 when $300 android was just sufficient. He never said it, but I know to look cool.

### Social Pressure
Why do 11 years old buy skins/crap in Fortnite and are spending over $500+ on a "free" game? Because if they don't they won't be invited in same skin party. They will be left out. And that is very serious blow to self-worth of 11 years old.

### Unique Solution
Sometimes a product is almost exactly the same in every aspect to cheaper product but just something very small is very uniquely different just for me and I have to use it and there is nothing else exactly like that. Think Niche, maybe even unintended niche sometimes.

### Self-Esteem
I buy new t-shirts not because my t-shirts are unwearable but because bad clothes affect my self esteem.


### Aesthetics
I buy something that looks really beautiful compared to other products. Think why we like diamonds, paintings, and such.

### Quantity
Sometimes I just one or three of some items, say screws, I don't want to buy a pack of 50. Even if per screw of pack of 50 is much cheaper.

### Reliability
Professional pay premium to get tools that will last a decade.

### Performance
People pay 3x more for slightly better product, i.e. Gamers
